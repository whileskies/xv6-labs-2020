1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
Answer: a0-a7 registers contain arguments to functions, a2 holds 13.

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
Answer: f and g are not called in main, and their results are directly given due to inline assembly and compiler optimization.

3. At what address is the function printf located?
Answer: 0x630

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
Answer: 0x38

5. Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
Answer: "HE110 World", If the RISC-V were instead big-endian we need set i to 0x726c6400, and don't need to change 57616.

6. In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
Answer: x=3, y is not a specific value. Guess y is the value of the a2 register. a0 stores the addr of "x=%d y=%d", a1 stores 3, thus y is the value of a2.
